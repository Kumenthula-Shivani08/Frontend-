        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line baking sheets with parchment paper.
          </li>
          <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy.
          </li>
          <li>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Then, stir in the vanilla extract.
          </li>
          <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.
          </li>
          <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.
          </li>
          <li>Fold in the chocolate chips until evenly distributed throughout the dough.
          </li>
          <li>Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, leaving some space between each cookie.
          </li>
          <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes or until the edges are set. The centers may still look slightly undercooked, but they will continue to set as they cool.
          </li>
          <li>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.
          </li>
          <li>Enjoy your delicious homemade chocolate cookies with a glass of milk or your favorite beverage!
